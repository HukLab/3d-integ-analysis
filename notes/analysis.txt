STRUCTURE
----------------------
two analyses:
    threshold (% correct vs. coherence)
        increasing duration you integrate the stimulus
        but only up to a point--after a critical duration, incoming sensory input does not benefit performance
        => elbow fit
    tau (% correct vs. duration)
        two mechanisms for motion integration over time:
            1. ~=bounded
                as soon as enough signal has entered the system, a decision is made
                => stronger motion coherence should yield lower tau (i.e. earlier time)
            2. ~=urgency/leaky?
                regardless of rate of signal strength, a decision is made
        not necessarily the case that 2d/3d would show the same tau dependence on coherence
            but they appear to be
            (they look like shifted versions of one another)
