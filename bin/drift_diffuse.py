    t is duration
    C is coherence
    k relates the drift rate to C

    From Selen et al. (2012):
        dX = kCdt + dW

            t = duration
            W = standard Brownian motion with unit variance over one second
        This yields (according to the paper):
            f(X) = N(kCt, t) = gaussian with mean kCt, variance t
        =>
            p(C, t) = P(X == 1 | C, t) = 1 - (f(X) <= 0) = 1 - F(0)
            n.b. F(0) = 0.5 + 0.5*erf(-kCt / sqrt(2*t))]
        =>
            p(C, t) = 1 - F(0) = 0.5 - 0.5*erf(-kCt / sqrt(2*t))
